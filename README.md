<h1>Simple JS Popup</h1>
Optimized, responsive, easy to use modal window made in JavaScript. Without jQuery!
In order to use it in your project, you just need to insert the necessary classes from your HTML markup into the script when declared a variable here:

```javascript
let more = document.querySelector('.more'), //Popup initialize button
    overlay = document.querySelector('.overlay'), //Popup overlay
    close = document.querySelector('.popup-close'); //Popup close button
```  

    
Also you can just copy my HTML and paste to your markup in order for the script to work exactly.  

Thank you for visiting my Github page, you can check another scripts on this profile. I think that they will be useful to you in your projects!

Bye and good luck!
